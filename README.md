# TODO
-tune ngrid values to find acceptable steering configuration
    - NOTE: minimum incrementation is currently disabled (not run yet)

    ackermann achieved slightly, still in need of tuning
    currently inner angle is bigger than outer by 1.8-2 degrees, target  5 
    30 degree in, 29 out, keep trying to push this

    implement calcualtion for ackerman angle and increase factors to achieve towards ideal.
